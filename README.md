## Overview

Connectons+ reimagines the classic Connections puzzle with a more unpredictable format. Instead of four tidy groups of four, this version gives you word clusters of all shapes and sizes.

The game features multiple difficulty levels, customizable UI settings, and intuitive controls.

## How to Play

### Objective
Group the words by their hidden connections. Each word fits into one‚Äîand only one‚Äîgroup. The catch? You don‚Äôt know how many words are in each group. üòâ

### Gameplay

1. Click on the words you think belong together.
2. Hit **Submit** to check your guess.
3. Keep going until all groups are found.

### Controls

- Click a tile to **select** or unselect it.
- Use **Submit** to check your current group.
- **Deselect All** clears your selection.
- **Shuffle** mixes up the tiles.
- **New Game** starts over with a new puzzle.
- **Difficulty Toggle** switches between Easy, Medium, and Hard modes.

### Feedback System

To help (but not spoil):

- ‚úÖ **Correct selections:** You'll get praised and the tile will move to the solution area with their connection revealed.
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Partially correct submissions (more than half right):** Reveal how many tiles are correct.
- ‚ùå **Mostly incorrect:** You'll get a generic "nope" message.
- üîÑ **Repeated submissions:** The game will nudge you to try something new.
